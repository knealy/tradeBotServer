### Advanced Optimizations

#### F. Database for Persistent State
**Problem**: Cache is lost on restart
**Solution**: Use SQLite or PostgreSQL for persistent caching
**Impact**: Eliminates cold cache on restart

#### G. Async Webhook Server
**Problem**: Webhook server blocks on I/O
**Solution**: Convert to async/await pattern
**Impact**: Handles 10x more concurrent requests

#### H. Metrics & Monitoring
**Problem**: No visibility into performance bottlenecks
**Solution**: Add Prometheus metrics or similar
**Impact**: Identify slow operations in production

#### I. Background Task Optimization
**Problem**: Multiple background tasks compete for resources
**Solution**: Use priority queues and task scheduling
**Impact**: Better resource utilization


set flag option on stop bracket to move stop to breakeven after positions are in prof 15pts+

move away from the json/webhook parsing for trade orders with webserver 
- implement full overnight range break strategy directly into bot :
-- track highest price / lowest price every night between 6pm and 9:30am EST (start/end time set in env)
-- calculate current price atr and atr for the day / daily atr zone (see @mom_current.pine) 
-- at 9:30am EST (set time in env) set stop bracket orders slightly above/below these price extremes for these range breaks 
-- stop around -1 to -1.5 current atr from entry
-- tp around Daily atr zone 

go over options for fastest / most effecient frontend - bridge - backend structures and tech stack 
- make a plan to port / convert (probably to Go + React + JS) 
- is Go the best choice?

#### J. Go/Rust Migration (Future)
**Problem**: Python GIL limits concurrency
**Solution**: Migrate hot paths to Go/Rust
**Impact**: 10-100x performance improvement for I/O-bound operations

### ✅ FIXED: Order Rejection Issues (Nov 7, 2025)

**Problem**: Strategy orders rejected by TopStepX platform
- "Rejected (Invalid stop price. Price is not aligned to tick size.)"
- "Rejected (Order price is outside allowed range.)"

**Root Cause**: 
- ATR calculations produced prices like 25299.80, 24763.95
- MNQ tick size is 0.25, so only .00, .25, .50, .75 are valid
- Prices like .80, .95 are invalid and get rejected

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Added `get_tick_size()` method - fetches tick size from contract info
2. Added `round_to_tick()` method - rounds prices to valid tick increments
3. All prices (entry, stop, TP) now rounded before order placement
4. Added price validation (stop < entry for LONG, stop > entry for SHORT)
5. Added sanity checks for extreme price deviations (20% from midpoint)
6. Caches tick sizes to avoid repeated API calls

**Example Fix**:
```
Before: Entry=25355.00, SL=25299.80, TP=26194.71 ❌
After:  Entry=25355.00, SL=25299.75, TP=26194.75 ✅
```

**Tick Sizes by Symbol**:
- MNQ, MES, ES, NQ: 0.25
- MYM, YM: 1.0
- M2K, RTY: 0.10
