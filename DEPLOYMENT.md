### **Step 1: Prepare Your Code**
Your project is already set up with the necessary files:
- ‚úÖ `Procfile` - Tells Railway how to run your app
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- ‚úÖ `webhook_server.py` - Your webhook server

### **Step 2: Deploy to Railway**

1. **Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Sign up** with GitHub
3. **Click "New Project"**
4. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. **Choose your projectXbot repository**
6. **Railway will automatically deploy!**

### **Step 3: Get Your Webhook URL**

After deployment, Railway will give you a URL like:
```
https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

**Use this URL in your TradingView alerts!**

### **Step 4: Set Environment Variables**

In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Add these environment variables:
   ```
   PROJECT_X_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   PROJECT_X_USERNAME=your_username_here
   ```

## üîß **Environment Variables**

Both services need these environment variables:

```bash
PROJECT_X_API_KEY=your_topstepx_api_key
PROJECT_X_USERNAME=your_topstepx_username
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Never commit your API keys to GitHub! Use the cloud service's environment variable settings.

## üß™ **Testing Your Deployment**

### **Test with curl:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app-name.railway.app/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "webhook"}'
```

### **Test with your test script:**
```bash
python3 test_webhook.py --url https://your-app-name.railway.app/
```

## üö® **Security Notes**

1. **Environment Variables**: Always use the cloud service's environment variable settings
2. **HTTPS**: Both Railway and Render provide automatic HTTPS
3. **Monitoring**: Check the logs in your cloud service dashboard
4. **Backup**: Your code is in GitHub, so it's automatically backed up

## üí∞ **Cost Comparison**

| Service | Free Tier | Best For |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Railway** | $5 credit/month | Python apps, easy setup |
| **Render** | 750 hours/month | Webhooks, APIs |
| **Heroku** | $7/month | Full-featured platform |

## üéâ **You're Ready!**

Once deployed, you'll have a permanent webhook URL like:

```

Use this URL in your TradingView alerts instead of the ngrok URL!

**No more port restrictions, no more changing URLs!** üöÄ
